Based on the readme, todo list, and full code file for this economics game, I'd like you to identify some logic or game design errors with the current code. Specifically, look for unclear mechanics in the game and try to make them easier to understand an use. 

When you make your changes, reproduce the entire code file. This is very important. At the end of each of your responses, highlight the next couple of things you think would be smart to change and continue developing
